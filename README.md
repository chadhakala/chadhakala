### Hi there 👋

<!--
**chadhakala/chadhakala** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on PHP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to how to host a domain and host a web server from a container
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making simple web applications
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting my unraid server on my domain 🤷🏼
- 💬 Ask me about why I'm the village idiot
- 📫 How to reach me: CHADHAKALA AT GMAIL
- 😄 Pronouns: CAT GOES BY HERMZ
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I ask for help, I likely read the manual and still don't know what to do and/or needlessly striving for perfection.
